# PandemyTracker
A project aimed to get a better understanding for Spring. This project is an attempt at creating a tracker for the ongoing covid pandemy.

Todo List:
Finish backend
- Way to download data from folkh√§lsomyndigheten in a more generic way.
- Fix so that dates are handled in the backend, rather than reading from data (as dates are sometimes not specified).
- Fix so that when downloading data it is stored in cache so that there is no need to download again (for that day for day data, for that week for week/region data).
- comment code
- write test cases

Finish frontend (any html, css, javascript)
